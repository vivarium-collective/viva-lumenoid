"""build_core() — the workspace core that composites and tests run against.

`process_bigraph.allocate_core()` auto-discovers processes/types from *installed
distributions* that depend on bigraph-schema (it scans
``importlib.metadata.packages_distributions()``). That works for sibling
``viva-*`` wrapper packages installed as regular wheels, but it does NOT see this
workspace's own package when it is installed *editable* (``pip install -e .`` —
the way CI and local dev install it): an editable install records only a
``.pth`` shim in its ``RECORD``, so ``packages_distributions()`` never maps this
package back to its distribution and the discovery scan skips it entirely. The
result is that any Process/Step defined IN this package is missing from the
core's link registry, and a composite addressing ``local:<ProcessName>`` fails
at build with::

    Exception: no link found at address: {'protocol': 'local', 'data': '<ProcessName>'}

So we register this workspace's own Process/Step classes explicitly here. The
registration is idempotent (a class already provided by auto-discovery — e.g. in
a non-editable / Docker install — is left untouched), so ``build_core()`` is
correct regardless of how the workspace was installed. A fresh scaffold with no
process classes yet is a clean no-op.
